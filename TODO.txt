Editor:

	- Copy and paste properties.
	- Change the center of an obstacle (so it can be rotated in the future).
	- Check polygon windings.

Game:

	- There should be sound.
	- There should be music.
	- There should be a certain amount of lives.
	- We could have some kind of "handicap" mode.
	- We should have a "select map" thingy.

Bots:

	- Fix the "stuck on rotation" bug (disable collision alltogether?).
	- Allow non aggressive pathfinding for returning to spawn point?.
